# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
----------------------
## Chapter 3 (from Duckett HTML book )

We have three type of list:
* *Ordered lists* : where each item in the list is numbered and the arrangement is important (ol - li)
* *Unordered lists* : lists that begin with a bullet point or another characters (ul - li)
* *Definition lists* : we used to add definitions of thing  ((dl + dt )-(dd)) 

Nested Lists : used to add list inside another list.

-------------------------

## Chapter 13 (from Duckett HTML book )

All element in HTML have a box in CSS.

## Chapter 2 (From the Duckett JS book)

An **array** is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values like:

var manes = ['ali','khamess' ,'abuyahia']; 

when we print names[0] it print ali

when we print names[1] it print khames

## Chapter 4 (From the Duckett JS book)

In if statment first we go to the condition if it trur then it will do the statment ,if it false it will do the else statment.
In switch statement we used it when the variable have alot of possible value it will break (stop) statement if a match is found.

Data type in JS:
* NUMERIC DATA TYPE
* STRING DATA TYPE 
* BOOLEAN DATA TYPE (true,false)
* null ( Empty value )
* undefined (Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value )

There are three loop statment in JS:
* for if we know how many time the code should run.
* while if we do not know how many time the code should run the statment will break when the conditions false.
* do while this statment will do the do statment if the while statment true.
