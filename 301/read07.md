#  REST
----------------------
## How I explained REST to my brother

Well, there's this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

But this is a very recent change! Just a few years ago, the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent. Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less. It was like trading simplicity for flashy tools and wizards.

we just tell Rails what we want our data to look like, and it takes care of all of the communication pieces for us. It's a huge boost for productivity!
