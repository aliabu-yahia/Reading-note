# Debugging and Error Handling
----------------------
## Chapter 10 (From the Duckett JS book)

There are two types of errors in JavaScript. The first is a programming error, where we, the JavaScript developers, do something wrong, the second type of error occurs when the web page reader answers a question incorrectly, pushes the wrong button.

Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them, (after open the browser click right click then choose inspect then press console)

When an Er ror object is created, it will contain the following properties:(Name,Massage,file name, line number)

There are seven types of built-in error objects in JavaScript. You'll see them on the next two pages:

1- Error : Generic error - the other errors are all based upon this error.

2- Syntax Error : Syntax has not been followed.

3- Ref erenceError : Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope.

4- TypeError : An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced.

5- Range Error : Numbers not in acceptable range.

6- URI Error : encodeURI ().decodeURI(),and similar methods used incorrectly.

7- Eval Error : eva l () function used incorrectly.
